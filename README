Simple Web Wallet Infopulse project.

Installation instructions

1. Update rmi settings in src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/config/config.txt to match serviceRmi settings. Defaults are localhost:1109.
2. Run gradlew ./build
3. Deploy at some servlet container. I used Tomcat.

Optional. If you use Tomcat, you can adjust cargo settings in gradle.build. Then you can build deploy with gradle cleanBuildDeploy.
